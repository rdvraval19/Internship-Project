# Linear Regression Model - Final Year Project

This project is a machine learning solution based on **Linear Regression**, aimed at predicting target values using a dataset with 13,320 records and 9 features. The model achieves a strong **R² score of 0.90**, indicating excellent accuracy and performance.

The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` (Pickle) file for easy reuse and deployment.

## 🚀 How to Run This Project

### 1. 🔓 Extract the Zip

- Download and extract the provided `.zip` file containing:
  - The `model.pkl` file
  - The `Final Project.ipynb` notebook
  - Any supporting files (e.g., dataset)

### 2. 📂 Place in a Folder

- After extraction, place **all files into one folder** for easier access.

### 3. 📒 Open Notebook

- It is **advisable to use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab** to run the project.

### 4. ▶️ Run the Notebook

- Open `Final Project.ipynb`
- Run each cell step by step to:
  - Load the dataset
  - Preprocess data
  - Train or load the model
  - Evaluate accuracy (R² Score, RMSE)
